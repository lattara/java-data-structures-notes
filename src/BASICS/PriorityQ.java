//A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be
// processed based on the priority. It is known that a Queue
// follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm,
// but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be
// processed according to the priority, thatâ€™s when
// the PriorityQueue comes into play. The PriorityQueue
// is based on the priority heap. The elements of the priority
// queue are ordered according to the natural ordering, or
// by a Comparator provided at
// queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.
// The class implements Serializable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, Queue<E> interfaces.
